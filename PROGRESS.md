# PROGRESS

> Machine-readable-ish status snapshot. Updated after every task per `DEVELOPMENT_LOOP.md` §11. If this file and `EXECUTION_LOG.md` ever disagree, `EXECUTION_LOG.md` (append-only, chronological) wins — fix this file to match it.

## Current phase

**Phase 0 — Foundation** (`MASTER_PLAN.md` → Phase 0)
Status: In Progress

## Current task

**P0-T04** — Mount `<InteractionProvider>`, import `interaction-layer.css`, and remove native smooth scrolling; then complete the Phase 0 runtime checks.
Dependencies `P0-T02` and `P0-T03` are complete.

## Completed tasks

- **P0-T01** — Installed GSAP 3.15.0 and Lenis 1.3.26; tests and production build pass.
- **P0-T02** — Added the interaction context/provider with one GSAP ticker, Lenis lifecycle, lerped mouse and scroll metrics, responsive state, CSS-variable updates, and reduced-motion behavior.
- **P0-T03** — Added the interaction-layer variable contract, stacking tokens, parallax base, active-only `will-change`, and reduced-motion overrides.

(Prerequisite work — PixelRobot rollout, card-grid fixes — was already completed on `main`/`work` before this plan existed: commits `5209461` and `1475eb7`. See `EXECUTION_LOG.md` P0-T00 entry for the baseline this plan starts from.)

## Blockers

None currently active.

**Upcoming, not-yet-active:** Phase 5 (`P5-T00`) decision recorded on 2026-08-09: extend `src/components/common/PixelRobot.jsx` with expressive poses and creatively bring the pixel robot to life with a friendly Claude-bot-like personality. Do not restore the deleted `Robot.jsx`. This decision does not change task order; formal Phase 5 implementation still begins only after its dependencies are complete.

## Next action

Start `P0-T04`: mount/import the completed Phase 0 foundation, remove native smooth scrolling, and run the full automated plus browser validation gate per `DEVELOPMENT_LOOP.md`.

## Repository baseline at plan creation (2026-08-09)

- `npm test`: 6/6 pass (`test/content.test.js`)
- `npm run build`: clean — `dist/index.html` 0.96KB, CSS 17.76KB (gzip 3.93KB), JS 274.48KB (gzip 85.09KB)
- `gsap`, `lenis`: not present in `package.json` (confirms P0 has not started)
- Uncommitted at plan creation (unrelated to this plan — do not touch): modified `whiteboard/*.docx` files, untracked `clg-placement/`, `docs/`, `whiteboard/Sujeth_Resume_V2_styled.docx`, `whiteboard/research/ats-scorecard-2026-06-10.md`. These belong to Sujeth's separate placement-prep/career workspace, not this dev loop.
